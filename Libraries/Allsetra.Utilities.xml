            NOTE: Don't change this unless you know what you're doing. Much of the backend
            is dependent on Dutch culture, such as the mileages that are stored from unit

            A safe to use dictionary that aims to be thread-safe and access-safe. Thread-safe means it can be
            accessed by multiple threads concurrently, though the caller is responsible for meaningful thread-
            safe access by locking with the SyncRoot property when multiple sequential actions are required.
            Access-safe means the dictionary will not care about missing keys and simply return default values
            so the caller can continue without worries. A setting is available to instantiate a default version
            of the value for missing keys as well, which can be useful for complex type value access.

            Don't worry about the non-synced accesses such as the Count property. I'm pretty sure they're atomic

            <para>
            A Thread Pool of which an instance can be created in order to split workloads into segments so

            Please note that use of this Thread Pool works best if use of Tasks are avoided. If work is queued
            that uses Tasks to complete, it will switch to the C# Thread Pool as soon as the Task is encountered,
            simply because that is how Tasks work. Please be aware that this Thread Pool does not mix well with
            Tasks and asynchronicity. Since any work ran by this Thread Pool receives a dedicated thread, the
            queued work is best set up to be synchronous as much as possible or at least return to the same
            thread after asynchronous work has completed.

            Please note that this ThreadPool has been tested, but may still contain some bugs. These bugs can
            be dependent on the type of work executed in this pool. For example, if too much work is queued that
            requires a connection to SQL, this work may fail on not being able to acquire a connection to SQL
            simply because there is too much work happening at once.

            the Thread Pool increases the minimum threads from 8 to 1000, it would trigger a Manage call. If the
            caller had to wait for that, he would be delayed for a good while. However if this change triggers a Manage
            call using this reset event, it would just let the Manage Monitor thread execute the Manage logic and
            the caller only has to wait for the reset event, which is negligible.
